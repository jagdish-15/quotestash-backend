- Sends response to confirm successful data reception
- Containerized for scalable deployment (e.g., Railway)

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- CORS
- Body-parser

## Usage

This backend is designed to work with the QuoteStash frontend and is **not intended for direct access**. All necessary backend communication is triggered by frontend interactions.
